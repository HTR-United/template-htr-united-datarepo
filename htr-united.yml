transcription-guidelines: >-
  The transcription strictly follows what is written on the images, including
  accentuation or capitalization errors. The segmentation follows the SegmOnto
  ontology and mostly relies on MainZone and DefaultLine. Beware that this
  dataset barely contains any ponctuation and that most lines begin with a
  capital letter.
